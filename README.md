## Article: [The rise of the Software Engineer](https://smartasset.com/retirement/the-rise-of-the-software-engineer)
Yes, I picked the article because the title sounds like a movie. 

The article focuses on understanding how the role of a Software Engineer has evolved over the years. Between 2003 and 2013, for example, there was a 50% increase in jobs in the field. The article also provides a list of cities in which the median salaries for Software Engineers is highest and cost of living is lowest (best city - Sioux City, Iowa). The authors also believe that the growth in roles will mostly be seen in SaaS (Software as a Service). In short, we chose the right class to take :)
