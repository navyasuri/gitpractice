## Article: [The Rise of the Software Engineer](https://smartasset.com/retirement/the-rise-of-the-software-engineer)
Yes, I picked the article because the title sounds like a movie. 

The article focuses on understanding how the role of a Software Engineer has evolved over the years. Between 2003 and 2013, for example, there was a 50% increase in jobs in the field. The article also provides a list of cities in which the median salaries for Software Engineers is highest and cost of living is lowest (best city - Sioux City, Iowa). Growth in technology leads to growth in the requirement of Software Engineers, and the trend of increasing available jobs is likely to continue. Software Engineers tend to make good many too! Lastly, the authors believe that the growth in roles will mostly be seen in SaaS (Software as a Service). 

### Thoughts
Most of the content was quite obvious but having the statistics available was a great insight into how the job market is doing. In short, we chose the right major and the class to take :)
